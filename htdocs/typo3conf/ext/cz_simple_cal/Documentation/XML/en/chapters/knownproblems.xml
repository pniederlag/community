				<para>There is a version for TYPO3 4.4 and Extbase 1.2 in the github repository 
				on the <literal>extbase-1.2</literal> branch. But this branch is deprecated. There might be some

			<para>Updating problems due to the development in progress of extbase might occur.</para>
			<para>
				As extbase is still under heavy development and this extension uses some methods that
				are not marked as public API, there might be problems when updating your <productname>Extbase</productname>
				installation. We hope to fix them as soon as possible, but you should be aware of that issue.
